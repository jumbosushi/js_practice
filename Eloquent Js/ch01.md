java has nothing do with javascript - it was only done for marketing reasons.

ECMAScrit == Javascript

#nowIknow

Js are equipped with default 64 bits

####Operators
% is h operator to show the remainder
```
344 % 100 = 44
```

There are Infinity & -Infinity & NaN

####Strings
\ is called escaping
    => implies a special effect chr
If two backslash follow each other, it will cancel each other out

```
"Check this \n out " <= X
"Check this \\n out" <= Ok
```

typeof operator show the type of a thing
ex. typeof 4.5      => number

< & > can be applied to strings as well!

```
console.log("Atsushi" < "Zack")
// true
```
Basically,

non-alphabet < UPPERCASE < lowercase
**A < Z**

####Logical Operator

Most things you already know, but a thing to note is:

```
console.log(true ? 1 : 2)
// 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2)
// 2
```

Boolean ? if-true-result : if-false-result

Another cool thing is ==== which is the precise logical operator to check

####Nifty work-around with logic operators

|| will
- return return value to left if it can be turned to true
- will return value on right otherwise
- on top of doing usual boolean comparison!

```
console.log(null || "YO")               //YO
console.log("Judy" || "Mike")           //Judy
console.log(true || "<- always true")   //ture
```
Another example is false && X => false

**This is called short-circuit evaluation**

###Auto Type Conversion
I knew about num -> str, but!
```
console.log(8 * null)   //0
console.log("5" - 1)    //4
console.log("five" * 2) //NaN
console.log(false == 0) //true

//cool one
console.log(null == undefined) //true!
```
