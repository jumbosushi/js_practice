Notes taken from the book + the code that I use to learn javascript

10/27/15: 
Working on JavaScript: The Definitive Guide 6th Edition

11/25/15: 
Started [Javascript.isSexy's js tutorials](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/) recommended by a friend!

12/18/15: 
Realized some aspect of the content in js track on the previous website is outdated, and then found [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/34zr9u/dated_material_in_beginning_javascript_4th_edition/) about the same point. Looked for new resource and stumbled upon [Derek Siver's blog post](https://sivers.org/learn-js). 
In short, will go with Eloquent Javascript from this point!
