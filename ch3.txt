Types, values, and variables


Js has two types: primitive type and object type
primitive: strings, boolean, null, undefined
object: properties, functions,

"constructors" - functions written to make new object 

JS has also mutable and immutable types (whether they can be edited or not).
- String is immutable!

Varibales are declared with "var"
Js variables are untyped

var outside functinos -> global variable
var within functions -> have function scope

-------
3.1 Numbers

All numbers are 64 bit floting-point value AKA between -2^53 to 2^53
This raises a problem:
>>var x = 0.3 - 0.2
>>var y = 0.2 - 0.1
>>x == y // return false 

With addition to base 10 numbers, js also accept base-16 numbers
(0-9 and A-F)
-> call it with "0x" or "0X"
ex. 0xff // 15*16 + 15-> 255

base-8 numbers are called by "0"
ex. 0377 // 3*64 + 7*8 + 7 = 255

"Math" object provide powerful mathmatical tools
ex. Math.round(0.6) -> 1.0
       Math.max(x,y,z) // return the highest number 

"Infinity" and "-Infinity" exists!
0/0 or inifinity / 0 will produce NaN - Not a Number

To check for NaN:
-x != x will produce true if and only if x is NaN
-.isNaN() 

Setting the date:
>> var now = new Date( 2010, 0, 1, 17, 10, 30)
	-> 1st day of the 1st month in 2010 at 5:10:30 pm
>> var.getFullYear()
>> var.Day()
>> var.toString()

-----------------
3.2 Text

String can be made by both ' ' or " "
' ' can be put inside " ", and vice versa
ex. 'name = "MyForm" '

When incorporating Js with HTML, the best practice is to decide and 
follow which quotation to use for which
This is because HTML can contain Js code in some cases:
ex. <button onclick="alert('Thank you')"> </button>

Escape sequence 
 --> used to show the charc otherwise unshowable 
ex. 'You/'re right!'
/x__ --> greek word where _ are hex digits
